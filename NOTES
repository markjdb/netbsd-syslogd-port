1. Option conflicts:
   * FreeBSD: -o means "print the full name of the kernel file" instead of just "kernel".
   * NetBSD: -o <output_format> allows users to choose between RFC 3164 format
     and RFC 5424 format.

   * FreeBSD: -P <file> allows one to specify an alternate PID file.
   * NetBSD: -P <file> is used to allow one to specify a list of sockets in a file.

   * NetBSD: -S means "sync kernel messages immediately after receiving them."
   * FreeBSD: -S <socket> is used to specify an alternate socket for privileged
     applications
     - FreeBSD syslogd uses syntax in syslog.conf to specify whether a log file
       should be synced after it's been written; by default, kernel logs ARE
       synced.

   * FreeBSD: -u "unique priority logging", basically changes the priority
     comparison operator from >= to ==.
     - Note that this is NetBSD's -U.
   * NetBSD: -u <uid> set UID after daemonizing.

2. NetBSD options that aren't present on FreeBSD:

   * -u <uid>: set UID after daemonizing.
   * -g <gid>: set GID after daemonizing.
   * -t <dir>: chroot to dir after daemonizing.
     - These three options will be kept, except that they'll become -U, -G
       and -t to avoid a conflict with FreeBSD syslogd's -U.

   * -r: don't compress duplicate log messages.
     - FreeBSD uses -c for this, and "-c" and "-c -c" have different meanings.
   * -S: sync kernel messages to disk immediately

3. FreeBSD options that aren't present on NetBSD:

   * -4: force syslogd to use IPv4 only (done)
   * -6: force syslogd to use IPv6 only (done)
   * -8: don't mess with the high bit
   * -A: when forwarding to a host, try to send the message to all address
         records (done)
   * -a peer: allow the specified peer to log to this syslogd instance (done)
   * -b 'host:port': bind to the specific host/port (NetBSD doesn't provide
                     the port field, but the option is otherwise there) (done)
   * -C: create log files if they don't exist (done)
   * -k: preserve the "kern" facility of incoming messages (done)
   * -l: specify locations for additional log sockets, along with perms (done)
   * -N: disable binding on UDP sockets (done)

4. Things left to do (incomplete):

- Add "sync log file" syntax to syslog.conf
- Man page updates
- Add -8
  - I don't really want to do this - by default, syslogd maps C1 sequences
    (which fall in the range 0x80 to 0x9F) in the message body to some ASCII
    representation. What's the point of that? Then -8 needed to be added to
    ensure that UTF8-encoded messages don't get mangled. Moreover, rfc5424
    recommends the use of UTF-8.
- IPv6 support for syslog.conf, -b...
- Add ability to bind to multiple sockets with -b (bin/159305)
- Add support for multiple configuration files (Ryan posted about this somewhere)

5. Random observations.

- FreeBSD is calling double_rbuf() in the wrong place for local sockets.
- NetBSD is using strncpy incorrectly(?) when allocating local sockets
- Various options will need to be expanded to allow for non-UDP transports
  (e.g. -a)
- We need to try creating the PID file earlier - otherwise we unlink an
  already-running syslogd's sockets..
- The implementation of -a is really ugly. I'd like to get rid of it and just
  say "use hosts.allow".

6. FreeBSD changes that need to be ported over.
- Support for IPv6 addrs in the destination of a syslog.conf rule.
- Tell the kernel that syslogd shouldn't be killed when swap space is exhausted
- avoiding races in signal handlers
