1. Option conflicts:
   * FreeBSD: -o means "print the full name of the kernel file" instead of just "kernel".
   * NetBSD: -o <output_format> allows users to choose between RFC 3164 format
     and RFC 5424 format.

   * FreeBSD: -P <file> allows one to specify an alternate PID file.
   * NetBSD: -P <file> is used to allow one to specify a list of sockets in a file.

   * NetBSD: -S means "sync kernel messages immediately after receiving them."
   * FreeBSD: -S <socket> is used to specify an alternate socket for privileged
     applications
     - FreeBSD syslogd uses syntax in syslog.conf to specify whether a log file
       should be synced after it's been written; by default, kernel logs ARE
       synced.

   * FreeBSD: -u "unique priority logging", basically changes the priority
     comparison operator from >= to ==.
     - Note that this is NetBSD's -U.
   * NetBSD: -u <uid> set UID after daemonizing.

2. NetBSD options that aren't present on FreeBSD:

   * -u <uid>: set UID after daemonizing.
   * -g <gid>: set GID after daemonizing.
   * -t <dir>: chroot to dir after daemonizing.
     - These three options will be kept, except that they'll become -U, -G
       and -t to avoid a conflict with FreeBSD.

   * -r: don't compress duplicate log messages.
     - FreeBSD uses -c for this, and "-c" and "-c -c" have different meanings.
   * -S: sync kernel messages to disk immediately

3. FreeBSD options that aren't present on NetBSD:

   * -4: force syslogd to use IPv4 only (done)
   * -6: force syslogd to use IPv6 only (done)
   * -8: don't mess with the high bit
   * -A: when forwarding to a host, try to send the message to all address
         records
   * -a peer: allow the peer to log to this syslogd instance
   * -b 'host:port': bind to the specific host/port (NetBSD doesn't provide
                     the port field, but the option is otherwise there) (done)
   * -C: create log files if they don't exist (done)
   * -k: preserve the "kern" facility of incoming messages (done)
   * -l: specify locations for additional log sockets, along with perms
   * -N: disable binding on UDP sockets
