This is a little project which aims to replace FreeBSD's syslogd with NetBSD's
syslogd, which has more features and in particular supports reliable and secure
transport layers (i.e. not UDP).

What I'd like to do here is:
1. Get netbsd-syslogd to compile on FreeBSD and write src and ports makefiles
   for it.

2. Go through all of the history of FreeBSD's syslogd and look for features and
   bug-fixes that should be ported over to netbsd-syslogd, the intent being to
   allow netbsd-syslogd to become a drop-in replacement for FreeBSD's syslogd.

   Both daemons come from a common code base, but they've diverged in e.g.
   command-line options, syslog.conf syntax.

3. Try and determine whether it'd be easy to replace the use of libevent with
   kqueue, and then select the interface using a compile-time switch or
   something. This isn't really necessary but it'd remove the dependency on
   libevent, which would be nice if this ever gets considered for import into
   the FreeBSD src tree. We'll see whether it can be done cleanly and without
   too much new code.
